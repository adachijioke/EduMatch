# EduMatch - AI-Powered Decentralized Tutoring Platform

## Project Pitch

EduMatch revolutionizes online tutoring by combining artificial intelligence with blockchain technology to create a secure, efficient, and rewarding educational marketplace. Our platform solves three critical problems in online education:

1. **Trust & Quality**: Traditional platforms lack reliable verification of tutor credentials and quality
2. **Payment Security**: Students and tutors face risks with traditional payment methods
3. **Engagement**: Current platforms offer limited incentives for participation and quality teaching

### Our Solution

EduMatch addresses these challenges through:

- **AI-Powered Matching**: Our sophisticated algorithm analyzes learning styles, subject expertise, and scheduling preferences to create perfect student-tutor matches
- **Blockchain-Based Payments**: Smart contracts ensure secure payment escrow and automatic releases upon session completion
- **Token Economy**: Native EDU tokens incentivize quality teaching and active participation
- **Verifiable Reputation**: On-chain reputation system provides transparent and immutable feedback
- **Real-Time Learning**: Integrated video conferencing with collaborative tools enables seamless remote sessions

### Technical Innovation

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts handle payments, reputation, and token rewards
- **AI Integration**: Machine learning algorithms optimize tutor-student matching
- **Web3 Integration**: MetaMask wallet connection for blockchain interactions
